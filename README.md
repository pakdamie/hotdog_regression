# hotdog_regression

What are the hotdog prices across the baseball stadiums? 
Can we use regression to understand the facts associated wtih hotdog prices? 

## Scraping information
I scrape baseball stadium data from Wikipedia and scrape the hotdog prices from the Washington Journal of Sports (see scrape_data.py)
